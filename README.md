### Trading Functions
The code includes various functions to execute buy and sell orders based on the system's entry/exit signals. It also calculates and manages position sizes based on risk management rules. Other functions handle stop-loss and take-profit levels, implement trailing stop functionality, and facilitate partial closure of positions.

### Stability and Performance
The code is designed to be stable and perform efficiently. It is optimized for speed and accuracy, ensuring timely execution of trading logic. Error handling and logging mechanisms are implemented to facilitate debugging and ensure smooth operation.

### Documentation and Parameters
The code is well-documented with clear and concise comments and explanations of the implemented functions. It includes documentation on specific rules or parameters used in the system, providing insights into the trading strategy.

### Testing and Optimization
Thorough testing of the code is conducted to ensure accuracy and reliability. Based on testing results, the code is optimized to improve performance and enhance trading outcomes.

### Integration
The code is designed to be easily integrated into existing trading platforms or systems. It provides necessary documentation and instructions for seamless integration.

### Logical Conclusion
The code includes the logic to conclude the program based on the trading strategy. It ensures that the trading robot operates effectively and consistently.
